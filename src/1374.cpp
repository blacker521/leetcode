#Leetcode# Q1374 生成具有奇数字符的字符串
难度：低
给定一个整数n，返回一个包含n个字符的字符串，以使该字符串中的每个字符出现奇数次。
返回的字符串只能包含小写英文字母。如果有多个有效字符串，则返回其中任何一个。
约束条件：
(1) 1 <= n <= 500

例1:
Input: n = 4
Output: "pppz"
Explanation: "pppz" is a valid string since the character 'p' occurs three times and the character 'z' occurs once. Note that there are many other valid strings such as "ohhh" and "love".

例2:
Input: n = 2
Output: "xy"
Explanation: "xy" is a valid string since the characters 'x' and 'y' occur once. Note that there are many other valid strings such as "ag" and "ur".

例3:
Input: n = 7
Output: "holasss"
